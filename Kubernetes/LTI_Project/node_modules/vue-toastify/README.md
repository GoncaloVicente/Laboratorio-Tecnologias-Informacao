I wanted a notification plugin which I can use by passing props from the server and can also be called at run time. With this component it's has just become super easy. It's easily extendable and customizable and it has no dependencies.

Check it out at [Netlify](https://vue-toastify.netlify.com/)

Requires Vue 2.2.0+

## Quick start:

```shell script
npm i vue-toastify
```
or with CDNs:
 - [jsDeliver](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue-toastify@latest)
 - [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/vue-toastify)
 
 ***

In your main js file:

```javascript
import VueToastify from "vue-toastify";
Vue.use(VueToastify);
```
 Then anywhere just call:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.success("easy-peasy");
```

## Settings

You may pass a settings object to the use statement like so:

```javascript
Vue.use(VueToastify, {
    my: "settings"
});
```
or change any of the settings during run-time with the following
 
```javascript
this.$vToastify.setSettings(settingsObject);
```
This will return the current settings after the updates.


To use the vue router supported features pass in the router to the use statement as the 3rd argument like so:
```javascript
import routerLoadedWithRoutes from "./router";

Vue.use(VueToastify, {}, routerLoadedWithRoutes);
```

### Available settings

 setting | type | default | details |
---|---|---|---
| singular | Boolean | false | Only allow one notification on the screen at a time, others will be queued up for showing later. |
| withBackdrop | Boolean | false | Enables backdrop to be shown. |
| backdrop | String | "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" | The rgba value for the backdrop. |
| position | String | "bottom-right" | Defines where the notifications should be showing on the screen. Available values are: `"top-left"`, `"top-center"`, `"top-right"`, `"center-left"`, `"center-center"`, `"center-right"`, `"bottom-left"`, `"bottom-center"`, `"bottom-right"` |

| successDuration | Number | 4000 | The duration in milliseconds the success notification should be visible for. |
| warningInfoDuration | Number | 6000 | The duration in milliseconds the warning and info notification should be visible for. |
| canTimeout | Boolean | true | Whether the notifications disappears after the set time. |
| canPause | Boolean | true | Whether the notifications can be paused by hovering over them. |
| hideProgressbar | Boolean | false | Whether the progressbar should be shown on the notification or not. |

| orderLatest | Boolean | true | Whether new notifications should display on top of the stack or not. |
| transition | String / Object | null | If string supplied this will apply the usual transition classes (eg.: .name-enter-active), if object supplied it expect a `name` and optionally a `moveClass` (this class has to use `!important` for its rules) attribute. The name will be applied as above. The move class applied when the notifications adjust their position. |

| draggable | Boolean | true | Whether to enable dismissing the notification by dragging or not. |
| dragThreshold | Number | 0.75 | A number between 0 - 5 representing how far the notification should be dragged to dismiss. |
| baseIconClass | String | null | If string is set, this will be appended to every user supplied icon's class. |
| maxToasts | Number | 6 | Defines how many toasts should be visible at a time. Others are queued. |
| oneType | Boolean | false | If turned on, only toasts with unique mode/type will be show. Others are queued. |

To fetch the current setting you may run the following which will return all the settings.

```javascript
this.$vToastify.getSettings();
```
You may optionally pass an argument to the above to only get the value for that key.

## Status
You can pass to the functions either a string for the body of the status and optionally a title for the second argument like so:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.error("body", "title"); 
```
Or pass an object to the method:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.info(stausObject);
```
The following properties can be set on the object:

 property | type  | details |
---|---|---
| body | String | Required parameter, you may pass html to this. |
| title | String | Enables pausing of the loader and the timeout on hover. |
| type | String | Defines what notification type should be showing available types: `"success"`, `"warning"`, `"info"`, `"error"` defaults to `"success"`. This can only be set if you're using `this.$vtNotify()` Alternatively you may use the methods: `this.$vToastify.warning("more readable")` |
| mode | String | If set the notification will be shown in the given mode: `loader`, `prompt`. Alternatively you may use the methods: `this.$vToastify.loader("more readable")`  |
| url | String / Object | If set, clicking on the notification will take the user to the given location. If its a string and used with router and route not found this will be ignored. If giving an object then you can either define attributes of the anchor tag like: `{ href: "https//google.com", target="_blank" }` or pass the object you would pass to the `router.push()` function. |
| icon | String / Object | If set, this will be displayed instead of the default icons. If is a string the string will be assigned to the class unless it is an svg. If it is an object it may take the following attributes `{ tag: "i", ligature: "", icon: "" }` |
| answers | Object| If the type is prompt the object keys will display to the user and the value will be returned in the promise. It defaults to `{ Yes: true, No: false }` (Note: to include special characters like space, `-`, `_`, etc use quotation marks: `"my key":` |
| callback | Function | This function will be called when the notification has been dismissed or the timeout has finished. |

You may additionally overwrite the following plugin settings on a notification by notification basis by adding them on the status object.

- `canTimeout`
- `canPause`
- `defaultTitle`
- `duration` - The time the notification is displayed for in milliseconds regardless of its type. (this cannot be updated later)
- `theme`
- `hideProgressbar`
- `transition`
- `iconEnabled`
- `draggable`
- `dragThreshold`
- `orderLatest`

You may alternatively pass in an http error response like:
```javascript
fetch().then().catch(error => this.$vToastify.error(error));
```
***
Only `this.$vToastify.error()` will look for `status` and `statusText` on the error object.

**Every notification method returns a unique id associated to your notification object.**
 
## Additional methods
**The notification supports multiple modes**

You can either pass the `mode` property on the status object which is one of the following strings: `"prompt"`, `"loader"` or by calling:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.loader("Please Wait...")
```
```javascript
this.$vToastify.prompt({
    body: "Are there hot singles in your area?",
    answers: { Yes: true, No: false }
})
```
The prompt does not return an id instead it returns a Promise so may use it as:
```javascript
...}).then(value => {
    if (value) {
        this.$vToastify.prompt("Is it a scam?")
            .then(value => console.log(value ? "Yay!" : "Nay"))
    }
})
```
The answers object consist of a key value pairs in the object where the key is displayed to the user and the value returned by the promise. If not set it defaults to: `{ Yes: true, No: false }`.

There are various events are emitted by the notification:
 - `vtFinished`
 - `vtDismissed`
 - `vtStarted`
 - `vtPaused`
 - `vtResumed`
 - `vtDragStarted`
 - `vtBeingDragged`
 - `vtDragFinished`
 
 to which you can listen by either the `listen` or the `listenOnce` method. The event's payload is an object containing the notification's id:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.listen("vtDismissed", payload => console.log(payload.id))
```
The drag events will also include a property called `position` which is an object of `{ x: Integer, y: Integer }` where x is left and y is top offset in pixels from the client view port.

### Miscellaous methods:

A loader cannot be dismissed, you'll have to stop the loader yourself like so:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.stopLoader(id)
```
This will stops the loader with the given id or loaders if array of ids given. If no id provided, all loaders will be closed. It will return the count of the loaders stopped.


For returning a notification object use:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.getToast(id)
```
This if found returns the notification object from the visible ones or queued toasts otherwise all of the notification objects in an array from both the visible and queued toasts. If not found returns false.

For updating the notification object during run-time use:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.changeToast(id, statusObject)
```
This will merge the object you pass in and the existing notification. It will return true if successfully updated and false if the notification isn't found.

For removing a notification use:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.removeToast(id)
```
This will remove the notification if the id is given otherwise it will remove all of the notifications. If id supplied and not found between the queued or currently displaying notifications, it will return false, otherwise it returns the ids of the currently visible notifications.

***
To pass a notification from the server, assign your notification object to `window.notification` before importing your scripts. On mount this will gets displayed to the user. If this notification object has a property called `delay`, the notification display will be delayed by the given number of milliseconds.

## Customisation

### Extending the functionality
You can add your own methods to the plugin like so:
```javascript
Vue.use(VueToastify, {
  customNotifications: {
    clientError: {
      body: "You did it!",
      defaultTitle: false,
      icon: '<svg width="50" height="50">\n' +
              '<rect width="50" height="50" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);" />\n' +
            '</svg> ',
      canTimeout: false
    },
    moreOfTheAbove: { ...
  }
});
```

If the above is defined in the `customNotifications` object, you can use this method like so:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.clientError("this will overwrite the body", "this will add a title");
```
or as usual pass in an object which will merge with the predefined props.

### Extending the styles

Default styles maybe overridden with `!important`. To add custom styles you all you have to do is follow the example in `./src/assets/toast.scss` and add your custom styles. Once added rename `.vt-theme-dark` to `.vt-theme-my-custom-name` and in the settings or the status object pass the theme as `theme: "my-custom-name"`. Include this stylesheet in the project and you're good to go.

## Usage
### Basic usage
In your main js file:

```javascript
import VueToastify from "vue-toastify";

Vue.use(VueToastify);
```
 Then anywhere just call:
```javascript
this.$vToastify.info("Easy as that");
```

### Vuex usage
```javascript
import Vue from "vue";

const mutations = {
  updateValue(state, value) {
    state.value = value;
    Vue.$vToastify("Successfully updated value!");
    // OR
    this._vm.$vToastify("Successfully updated value!")
  }
};
```
